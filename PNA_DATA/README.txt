This directory contains a set of files holding the data acquired on the various PNA studied.

The experiments were acquired on Absorbance and CD on a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter using 1mm path length 110 quartz UV cells.
Each run was performed first by heating, the temperature varying from 308 K to 368 K with a 1 K/mn variation rate, and then by a cooling experiment performed at the same rate.

Each file contains one measure on one PNA, at one wavelength, on a temperature series.
The files are distributed among several folders corresponding to different experimental runs.
The name of the file codes for the sample, the wavelength and the temperature variation (going up or down)
